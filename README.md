## Concept

A site to search events to meet-up with new people who like the same foods as you. The user will have the ability to sign up and create a user profile that will be visible to other users. A logged in user can create an event, view the events they are hosting as well as any other events they have joined. Users can join existing events from other users, view all events and click on a specific event for more details. Once a specific event has been selected the user can click on the host's profile to view their information and/or click to join the event.

## Motivation

We love to eat, like to meet new people and have good conversation and fun company when we go out, especially if we are traveling alone for work.

## Goals

- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (using JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
